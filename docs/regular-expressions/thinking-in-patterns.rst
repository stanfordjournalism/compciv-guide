Cory Doctorow wrote in a Guardian op-ed that regular expressions should be taught before general programming :cite:`Hello <doctorow_regex>`:

    Regular expressions are part of the fundamental makeup of modern software. They are present, in some form or another, in every modern operating system. Word processors, search-engines, blogging programs â€¦ though it's been decades since software for everyday people was designed with the assumption that users would know regexps, they still lurk in practically every environment we use.

    Knowing regexp can mean the difference between solving a problem in three steps and solving it in 3,000 steps. When you're a nerd, you forget that the problems you solve with a couple keystrokes can take other people days of tedious, error-prone work to slog through.
