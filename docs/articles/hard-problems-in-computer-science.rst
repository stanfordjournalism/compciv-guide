Cache invalidation
==================

    Caching is all about information locality. Invalidation means explicitly considering and developing the signals and data flows that are necessary to keep the cached information sufficiently fresh. This has an immediate meaning for the CEO. She can’t hope to read everything produced by everyone in the organization. She can’t even access most of it because she doesn’t know what to look for. Thus each organization creates its own forms of caches. The ‘executive summary’ – a purposefully glanceable one-page memo – is a well-known method of enterprise information caching.





Naming things
=============

    So, rather than over-analyzing the naming problem, I decided to under-analyze it. I picked the first thing that came to mind, which happened to be Monty Python’s Flying Circus, one of my favorite comedy troupes. The reference felt suitably irreverent for what was essentially a “skunkworks project”. The word “Python” was also catchy, a bit edgy, and at the same time, it fit in the tradition of naming languages after famous people, like Pascal, Ada, and Eiffel. The Monty Python team may not be famous for their advancement of science or technology, but they are certainly a geek favorite. It also fit in with a tradition in the CWI Amoeba group to name programs after TV shows.


On Style
--------

Nearly every stylistic concern in programming has its roots in how hard it is to name things.
