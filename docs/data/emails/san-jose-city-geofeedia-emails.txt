OK, I’m out at CSO interviews today so maybe we can touch base tomorrow. My main question is this still a
viable product for us or should we be spending our dollars else where. It would be nice to get our monies back
or a portion thereof since they dramatically changed the data on us.                          __ ___

Subject: Geofeedia Purchase Order

Hi Eva,


Regarding th e purchase o rd er fo r Geofeedia at $25,000. Invoice num ber IN403479.


W e do n ot w a n t to authorize th e purchase fo r th e Geofeedia order. O riginally w hen th e D epartm ent
requested w e make th e purchase, Geofeedia had th e capability o f view ing FaceBook, Instagram and T w itte r
on a single p la tfo rm . These th re e social media sites make up over 90% o f w h a t we w o u ld use the Geofeedia
service fo r, and w h y we agreed to purchase th e ir p la tfo rm in the firs t place. On Oct 10th, w e learned th a t th e
ACLU lodged a co m p laint against the com pany, w hich in tu rn caused Facebook, Instagram and T w itte r to pull
o u t o f th e ir relationship w ith Geofeedia. C urrently, Geofeedia does not have th e a b ility to provide the service
th e y had o rig in a lly promised.


Please let m e know if you need fu rth e r in fo rm a tio n on w h y w e should n o t move fo rw a rd w ith this purchase.

Hello Emily,

Have you tried emailing SJPDFiscal@sanioseea.gov?
They should be able to help you with paying invoices.
Otherwise, I would suggest contacting Lt. Mike Sullivan at                               or SJPD Fiscal at 408-277-4086.
